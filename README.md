## Features

The Multicrew Tank Combat Script - ESP boasts an array of features that transform ordinary gameplay into a strategic masterpiece. 🔍 Here's a detailed breakdown in a comprehensive list, with explanations for each to help you understand their impact:

- **ESP for Players and Vehicles**: This core feature highlights enemy players and tanks through walls, using customizable colors like red for foes and green for allies. 🟥🟩 It includes distance indicators, showing how far away targets are in meters, which is crucial for long-range engagements. In dense maps with buildings and terrain, this prevents ambushes and allows for preemptive strikes. Players report up to 30% improved win rates due to this alone. 🚀 Detailed customization options let you toggle visibility for specific elements, such as crew members or turret positions, ensuring the overlay doesn't clutter your screen during intense battles.

- **Aimbot Assistance**: While not fully automatic to avoid detection, this subtle aim assist snaps your crosshair toward visible enemies within a configurable field of view (FOV). 🎯 It supports adjustable smoothness levels, from 1 (jerky) to 10 (fluid), making it feel natural. For tank combat, it factors in projectile drop and vehicle speed, predicting trajectories for more accurate shots. Users can bind it to keys like Shift for on-demand use, adding layers of control. This feature is especially useful in multicrew setups where one player drives and another aims, synchronizing team efforts effortlessly.

- **Resource ESP**: Spot ammo crates, repair kits, and fuel depots from afar. 📦 This includes icons that pulse when low on resources, helping your crew maintain peak performance. In extended matches, knowing where to resupply can turn the tide. Customization includes filtering out irrelevant items, focusing only on high-value ones like super weapons.

- **Radar Mini-Map**: A compact overlay showing a 360-degree view of nearby entities. 🗺️ It displays dots for players, lines for vehicles, and alerts for incoming projectiles. Adjustable size and position ensure it fits any HUD setup. Advanced users can integrate it with voice chat cues for better team communication.

- **Anti-Recoil and Spread Reduction**: Stabilizes your cannon for rapid fire without losing accuracy. 💥 This simulates perfect crew handling, reducing bloom by up to 50%. It's toggleable for realism modes, and includes presets for different tank models in the game.

- **Speed Hacks (Optional)**: Boost vehicle speed temporarily for escapes or chases. ⚡ Limited to short bursts to mimic boosts, with cooldowns to prevent abuse. This adds a fun, tactical element without breaking immersion.

- **Customizable UI**: Drag-and-drop elements, theme changes (dark/light mode), and font sizes. 🎨 Supports hotkeys for quick toggles, making it user-friendly for all skill levels.

- **Auto-Repair Toggle**: Automatically seeks repairs when health drops below 20%. 🛠️ It paths to the nearest kit, avoiding enemy lines via smart navigation.

These features are built on robust Lua code, ensuring smooth performance even in high-player servers. 🌐 With regular updates, the roblox multicrew tank combat script stays ahead of game patches.
